## Description
Super Puppy is a game where a puppy barks sonic blasts to scare away bunnies from a garden. Super Puppy is a small pygame about the player character: Super Puppy. The goal of the game is to protect the garden from carrot eating bunnies. There are different types of bunnies and some are more difficult to scare of than others. I want to continue with this project and consider incorperating bunny movement along with having a companion character that joins further into the game as things become more chaotic.
