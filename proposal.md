## Description
Super Puppy is a game where a puppy barks sonic blasts to scare away bunnies from a garden. It is relevant to media and digital arts in that it will be a source of entertainment with digitally made art.
1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it is relevant to media and digital arts.

## Features
- pygame
	- I plan on using the pygames module to create Supper Puppy.
- multiple pixel art sprites
	- I will create the images in a separate program and use them as sprites.
- animated sprites 
	- create a series of images that simulate movement and import into pygame.

## Challenges
- learn how to detect interactions between spirits.
- learn how to create a scrolling screen map.
-research how to set win and lose conditions.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A scrolling map game that allows the player to move supper puppy right and left along with trigger actions to scare away bunnies. There will be a gui on screen that will report to the player the amount of bunnies on screen, bunnies needed to pass level, powerups available, and time left in level.  It will have six buttons to push left and right arrow keys control movement, up arrow key triggers supper bark, down activates power ups, p key pauses, and r key restarts the level.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Non-moving map allows players to move right to left. The supper puppy has one trigger button to scare away bunnies.
